        <ul id="FAQ-list">
          <li>
            <h2>When and where is the program?</h2>
            <p>
              The dates are June 21st - July 28th, 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this five week program, there are activities, experiences and parameters for
              participants that allow for this to be a context for profound, collective growth.
              Second City Summer is in Chicago, IL with our home base being the University of
              Illinois - Chicago (UIC). You may choose to live on campus at UIC, off campus in an
              apartment or with your family as long as they live within the city limits.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
            <p>
              Resident: $1000 // Includes all lodging, food, and program expenses
            </p>
            <p>Commuter: $500 // Includes all food and program expenses</p>
            <p>
              A resident is someone who will be living on campus at UIC for the duration of the program. A commuter will not be living on campus. Due to the relationship-building aspect of the program, we recommend that students live on campus together; however, we understand there are financial and family factors that we want to welcome. Our staff are eager to help anyone who may be deciding what their options are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bottom line: we do not want anyone to not apply based on based on finances or location or family obligations. We want to work with you to make sure that if God wants you here this summer, that you are well supported by us in getting here!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>What kind of job / internship will I be working? What if I can't find a job?</h2>
            <p>
              The only parameters for jobs is that they take place on weekdays between 6 am and 6
              pm (at least for the duration of the program). This can be an internship, any other type
              of job, a full-time volunteer situation, taking summer classes or a combination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our main concern is that you not work outside these parameters (which would prevent
                you from participating in the corporate life of this program) and that you have a
                productive, pre-approved way of spending your days.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>I've never fundraised before. Is it really possible to raise that much money?</h2>
            <p>
                Navigators is a non-profit organization, and can process and receipt charitable giving.
                Staff will help you through the entirety of this process. Believe it or not, there are many
                people in your community and background who would love the opportunity to make an
                investment in your life through a program such as Second City Summer (SCS).
            </p>
            <p>
                We will provide you with bible studies, materials, coaching and support to help you carry
                out this process.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>My mom or dad want to understand this program. What do I tell them?</h2>
            <p>
                SCS is an intentional way for you to spend five weeks in an environment where you will
                grow and mature in lasting ways. You will receive personal attention, mentorship,
                workshops and growth-experiences in the context of a dynamic and supportive
                community. The idea of SCS is that it is an investment—and intentional time of
                prioritizing your own personal and spiritual growth during the uniquely strategic times of
                college summer break.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of the many things you could do during these weeks, SCS represents a commitment to
                spiritual growth and maturity. This is anything but a frivolous decision.
